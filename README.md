# File-Compression-Decompression-Tool
A C++ implementation of the **Huffman Coding algorithm** for file compression and decompression. This project demonstrates the use of data structures (trees, priority queues, hash maps) and algorithms (greedy algorithms, tree traversals) to efficiently compress and decompress text files.
